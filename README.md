# Parametric-estimation-of-the-BDMM-process 

These codes and data are part of the supporting information of the article "Parametric estimation and LAN property of the birth-death-move process with mutations".

- ''Code'' contains the Python functions  to simulate a BDM process and plot some descriptors of the result. These programs are needed to run the examples in ''A-simple-example-of-simulation'' and  ''A-realistic-example-of-simulation''.

- ''An-example-of-simulations'' folder is an illustrative example of simulation of a simple BDM process, where the particles move inside the square [-10,10]x[-10,10], each following a Brownian motion without boundary conditions, and where the birth and death jumps occurs at a uniform rate, and there is no mutations. This folder also contains the results of 500 independent simulations used to display the figure in the article.

- ''A-realistic-example-of-simulation'' folder contains all materials to generate the BDM process considered in Section 3.2 in the article, and plot some descriptors. 

- ''Real-dataset'' contains two folders, one with the real-data presented in the article and the other one with the programmes witch allow to draw the heat map of the log-likelihood of these real dataset.
