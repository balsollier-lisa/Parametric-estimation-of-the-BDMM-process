# Parametric-estimation-of-the-BDMM-process 

These codes and data are part of the supporting information of the article "Parametric estimation and LAN property of the birth-death-move process with mutations", https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19367

- ''Code'' contains the Python functions to simulate a BDMM process, to compute the log-likelihood of the birth kernel, as parameterised in the article, deduce its maximum and the associated covariance matrix. These programs are needed to run the programs in ''An-example-of-simulation'' and in "Data".

- ''An-example-of-simulation'' contains the programs to simulate a simple BDMM process and the results of 500 independent simulations. It also contains the instructions needed to use the programs of "Code" in order to calculate the maximum likelihood of each simulation and to display Figure 2 in the article.

- ''Data'' contains two folders, one with some characteristics of the dataset used in the article, and the other one with the Python instructions to represent the log-likelihood heat map of this real dataset, along with the confidence ellipsoid centered at the maximum.
