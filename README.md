# Parametric-estimation-of-the-BDMM-process 

These codes and data are part of the supporting information of the article "Parametric estimation and LAN property of the birth-death-move process with mutations".

- ''Code'' contains the Python functions to simulate a BDM process. These programs are needed to run the example in ''An-example-of-simulation''.

- ''An-example-of-simulation'' folder contains the programmes to simulate a simple BDMM process, where the particles move inside the square [-10,10]x[-10,10], each either a Brownian motion, a subdhiffusive motion or a superdiffusif motion without boundary conditions, and where the birth and mutation jumps occurs at a uniform rate, and death intensity is proportional to the number of particles. This folder also contains the results of 500 independent simulations used to display the figure in the article.

- ''Real-dataset'' contains two folders, one with the real dataset presented in the article and the other one with the programs witch allow to draw the log-likelihood heat map of this real dataset.
