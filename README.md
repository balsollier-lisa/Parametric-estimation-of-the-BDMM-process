# Parametric estimation of the BDMM process 

These codes and data are part of the supporting information of the article "Parametric estimation and LAN property of the birth-death-move process with mutations", available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19367


- `Synthetic_data_analysis.py` is the main Python script for analyzing the simulated data contained in the `Synthetic_data` folder, as described in Section 4.1 of the article.


- `Data_analysis.py` is the main Python script for analyzing the real data provided in the `Data` folder, following the methodology presented in Section 4.2 of the article. 


- `Simulations.py` is the main Python script for simulating a synthetic trajectory, as those provided in the  `Synthetic_data` folder. 



- The `Codes` folder contains the Python programs needed to run the main scripts. 

- The `Synthetic_data` folder contains 500 independent simulations of the BDMM process, generated using the script `Simulations.py` and analyzed by the script `Synthetic_data_analysis.py`.

- The `Data` folder contains the real data analysed in the article, using the  script `Data_analysis.py`.
