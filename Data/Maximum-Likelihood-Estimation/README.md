# Heat map and confidence ellipse

In this folder, you find:

- "maximum_likelihood_estimation.py" contains programs for calculating the log-likelihood associated with the parametric model studied in the article (Section 4) and deducing the MLE. It also contains programs for displaying this log-likelihood in the form of a heat map with the ellipse around the maximum. This file is used to generate the image “heat_map_with_ellipse.png”. 

- “heat_map_with_ellipse.png” contains the heat map of the log-likelihood, with the estimated 95% confidence ellipse overlaid in black, centered at the maximum likelihood (marked with a 'x'), obtained with the programs that are in "maximum_likelihood_estimation.py".
