# Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation

In this folder, you find:

- "maximum_likelihood_estimation.py" calls the data in the "Characteristics" folder and uses the programs in "../Code" to calculate the log-likelihood for the parametric model studied in the article (Section 4) for this dataset. It also contains programs for displaying this log-likelihood as a heat map, along with the confidence ellipsoid centered at the MLE. 


- “heat_map_with_ellipse.png” contains the heat map of the log-likelihood for our dataset, with the estimated 95% confidence ellipse overlaid in black, centered at the MLE (marked with a 'x'). This plot is obtained by "maximum_likelihood_estimation.py".
