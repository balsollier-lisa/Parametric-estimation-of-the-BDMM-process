This folder contains :


- the file ''simulation.py'' contains the programs used to generate the simulations, the results of which are in the "500-simulations" folder. In these simulations, the particles move inside the square [-10,10]x[-10,10], each either following a Brownian motion, a subdiffusive motion or a superdiffusive motion without boundary conditions, and where the birth and mutation jumps occur at a uniform rate, while the death intensity is proportional to the number of particles. 
This program calls the functions in the “../Code” folder. 

- the folder "500-simulations" which contains the results of 500 simulations.
