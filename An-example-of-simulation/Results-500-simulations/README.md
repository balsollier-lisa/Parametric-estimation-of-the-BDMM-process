# Results-500-simulations 

This folder contains:


-"results_p.pickle" is a python file that contains all the values of p in the argmax of the log-likelihood for the 500 simulations of Results_simus folder.

-"results_sigma.pickle" is a python file that contains all the values of sigma in the argmax of the log-likelihood for the 500 simulations of Results_simus folder.

-"results_matcovtot.pickle" is a python file that contains all the value of the J matrix for the 500 simulations of Results_simus folder.


-"plot_max_with_ellipse.png" the result of the estimation of (p, sigma) = (0,4; 0.1) with 500 simulations of Results_simus folder. The median of the 95% confidence ellipses estimated (constructed from the median of the estimates of the covariance matrix J on all the simulations and centered in the median of the estimators) is plotted in red.
